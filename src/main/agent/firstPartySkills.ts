/**
 * First-party "system" skills that this app always ships into the Codex USER
 * skill scope (`$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).
 *
 * Codex itself only ships *binary-embedded* `.system` skills (re-extracted to
 * `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system` and wiped per binary version — see
 * `codex-rs/skills/src/lib.rs::install_system_skills`), so we cannot add to
 * that set without rebuilding Codex. The app-controlled equivalent of a
 * "system skill" is a skill we guarantee is present in the USER scope that
 * Codex natively discovers (the same place `save-skill` writes — required so
 * the model actually sees it, per openai/codex#21524). That scope is also what
 * the in-app skills panel lists, so the skill shows up there too.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: skill contents are NOT authored here. They live as
 * Markdown —
 *   - shared skills (also shipped via the plugin marketplace):
 *     `resources/plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`;
 *   - app-only skills: `resources/first-party-skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
 * `scripts/generate-first-party-skills.mjs` compiles them into
 * `./generated/firstPartySkills.generated.ts`, which this module re-packages.
 * Never edit the generated file (or inline content here) by hand.
 *
 * Authoring follows the Codex skill spec (`/openai/codex` skill-creator):
 *   - frontmatter has ONLY `name` (lowercase/numbers/hyphens, <= 64 chars) and
 *     `description`;
 *   - `description` is the sole triggering signal, so every "use when" cue must
 *     live there (the body is loaded only AFTER the skill triggers);
 *   - the body is imperative instructions.
